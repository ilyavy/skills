      - CS -> parallelism & concurrency
      - CS -> dynamic programming
    requires:
      - Future
      - Fork/Join framework
      - Parallel streams
      - Barrier & Phaser
      
      
    Parallel Programming:
      - Future
      - Fork/Join framework (RecursiveTask, RecursiveAction)
      - Parallel streams
      - Barrier & Phaser
      - Pipelines

      - Amdahl's Law
      - Critical Path in Computational Graph - how much faster the program can be due to parallelization?
      - Parallelism is effective until the number of threads exceeds the number of cores available.
      
      Algorithms:
        - Jacoby's -> iteratively converge... (https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallel-programming-in-java/lecture/vAOKr/3-4-parallel-one-dimensional-iterative-averaging)
